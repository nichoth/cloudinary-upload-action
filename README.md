## Usage

Add the following step to your workflow:

```yaml
    - name: Cloudinary Upload Image
      uses: nichoth/cloudinary-upload-action@v3.9
      with:
          cloud-name: ${{ secrets.CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME }}
          api-key: ${{ secrets.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY }}
          api-secret: ${{ secrets.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET }}
          public_id_prefix: "user-files"
          folder: "cool-folder-name"
          images: "./assets/*.jpg"
          reset: true
```

> [!WARNING]  
> If you pass in `reset` wihout passing in a `folder`, this will delete
> all assets from the Cloudinary account.

You can specify some options for creating assets in Cloudinary:

* `folder` -- Add all files to a subfolder
* `public_id_prefix` -- prefix for the filename
* `reset` -- Delete all assets before uploading. Make the Cloudinary API look
  exactly like the local files. The scope of the delete depends on the `folder`
  option passed in. Without a `folder` option, it will **delete all assets**
  from the Cloudinary account.
 

### Multiple files upload

You can upload multiple files with the `images` parameter putting a file path pattern.

```yaml
    - name: Cloudinary Upload Images
      uses: emmanuelgautier/cloudinary-upload-action@v2
      with:
          cloud-name: ${{ secrets.CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME }}
          api-key: ${{ secrets.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY }}
          api-secret: ${{ secrets.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET }}
          images: "./medias/**/*.jpg"
```

Or directly an array of files path.

```yaml
    - name: Cloudinary Upload Images
      uses: emmanuelgautier/cloudinary-upload-action@v2
      with:
          cloud-name: ${{ secrets.CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME }}
          api-key: ${{ secrets.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY }}
          api-secret: ${{ secrets.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET }}
          images: "[\"./medias/images/test1.jpg\", \"./medias/images/test2.jpg\"]"
```
